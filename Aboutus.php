We have finished the R&D of over 250 herbal items, which are now ready for manufacturing. Our manufacturing facility does not manufacture any poisonous or damaging items.
We have four major brands, and each brand offers a variety of items such as shampoo, hair oil, soaps, lotions, scrubs, and packs.
